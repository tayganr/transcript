Customer Service: Hello, thank you for calling HSBC. My name is Alice. How may I help you today?
Customer: Hi Alice, I have a problem with my debit card. It was declined when I tried to pay for my groceries.
Customer Service: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please tell me your account number and date of birth for verification?
Customer: Sure, my account number is 1234567890 and my date of birth is 15th of June, 1985.
Customer Service: Thank you. I have verified your identity. Can you please tell me your debit card number and expiry date?
Customer: Yes, my debit card number is 4567 8901 2345 6789 and the expiry date is 12/23.
Customer Service: Thank you. I have checked your card details and I can see that there is a security block on your card. This might have happened because of some unusual transactions on your account.
Customer: Unusual transactions? What do you mean?
Customer Service: Well, according to our records, there were three attempts to withdraw cash from an ATM in Paris, France yesterday. Did you make those transactions?
Customer: No, I did not. I have never been to Paris. Someone must have stolen my card details.
Customer Service: I see. In that case, we need to cancel your card immediately and issue you a new one. We will also refund any fraudulent charges on your account.
Customer: Thank you very much. How long will it take to get a new card?
Customer Service: It will take about 5 working days to receive your new card by mail. In the meantime, you can use our mobile app or online banking to access your account and make payments.
Customer: OK, thank you for your help.
Customer Service: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
Customer: No, that's all. Have a nice day.
Customer Service: Thank you for choosing HSBC. Have a nice day too. Goodbye.
